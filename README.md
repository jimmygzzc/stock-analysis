# Module 2 VBA Stock Analysis

## Overview of Project
* Steve loves the workbook you prepared for him. At the click of a button, he can analyze an entire dataset. Now, to do a little more research for his parents, he wants to expand the dataset to include the entire stock market over the last few years. Although your code works well for a dozen stocks, it might not work as well for thousands of stocks. And if it does, it may take a long time to execute.

## Results

* The edited code (refactored) gained over 70% eficiency, code and images below:

## Summary
The advantage of refactoring a code is that it allows us to improve upon an idea to build upon its foundation and expand its original intent and serve another purpose, it also provides an opportunity for another "set of fresh eyes" to catch performance issues or missed opportunities and even errors and make and improve it.

there is certainly the disadvantage of having to understand the code which depending on how clean and easy to read is, could take even more time than writing it from scratch.
